Collections is a framework which contains Collection interface. Itb helps in storing, retrieving and manipulating data inside a data structure.

Collections does not have a direct implementation.
List, st and queue are the ones that get implemented.


List : ordered & duplicate
Set : ordered & unique
Queue : FIFO
Stack : LIFO
Deque : it is same as queue and stack combined (both FIFO and LIFO) but we can remove elements from both ends.
