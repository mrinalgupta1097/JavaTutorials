Collections is a framework which contains Collection interface. Itb helps in storing, retrieving and manipulating data inside a data structure.

Collections does not have a direct implementation.
List, st and queue are the ones that get implemented.


List : ordered & duplicate
Set : ordered & unique
Queue : FIFO
Stack : LIFO
Deque : it is same as queue and stack combined (both FIFO and LIFO) but we can remove elements from both ends.

Big(O) notation 1. time complexity and 2. space complexity
    1. Time complexity : time to complete execution.
    best or worse case scenarios

    O(1) : constant time
    O(n) : time varies linearly with number of inputs

Time complexity of Arrays and Linked List :
    Arrays : search -> O(1)-> index based search
             add or remove -> O(N-1)
    LInked List : search -> O(n)
                add remove -> O(1)

Reverse strings
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int i = 0, j = s.length -1;
        while(i < j){
            char temp = s[i];
            s[i] = s[j];
            s[j] = temp;
            i++;j--;

        }

    }

            int i = 0, j = s.length -1;
            while(i < j){
                char temp = s[i];
                s[i++] = s[j];
                s[j--] = temp;

            }
